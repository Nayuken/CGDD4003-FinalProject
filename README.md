Final project for digital Media &amp; Interaction(CGDD 4003) written in C#

In this game, you will be taking control of a car as you navigate a the prohibition era collecting moonshine jugs and avoiding the law as they try to stop your good time!

You will have to use agility and quick thinking to moonshine jugs and stay alive. The Law will be trying to stop you from reaching your goal, so you must keep an eye out for them!

Collect 5 moonshine jugs before the time runs or the law catches you to win. Good luck and have fun!
